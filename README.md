## Transliterator tool

### Live preview - https://codepen.io/mibo/project/full/ABKQYK

If you don't have some specific keyboard for your PC (i.e. Hebrew / Russian / etc.) and you still need to type something in one of these languages it becomes to be a problem. You don't know blind-typing and you don't want to deal with mouse-clicking on virtual keyboard.

Here myTranslit comes to help you. It's a transliteration tool which converts English letters to phoneticaly same ones in another language. Example for Russian: "Слово" = "Slovo", example for Hebrew: "מילה" = "milh".

myTranslit also helps to people who can speak a certain language but cannot write.

You can type using the showed table of correspondence or just still use it as a virtual keyboard.

TECHNOLOGIES: HTML, CSS, JS Native
